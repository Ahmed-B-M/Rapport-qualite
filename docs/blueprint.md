# **App Name**: Delivery Insights Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Data Import and Processing: Allows users to upload XLSX files, process the data, and calculate delivery metrics (e.g., delivery success rate, average delay).
- Depot-Level Analytics: Generates and displays delivery performance metrics (success rate, average delay) broken down by depot. This uses reasoning to correlate late deliveries with specific depot.
- Warehouse-Level Analytics: Generates and displays delivery performance metrics broken down by warehouse.
- Carrier-Level Analytics: Presents performance metrics segmented by delivery carrier. The tool will analyze common failure modes and flag the worst failure reasons. 
- Driver-Level Analytics: Shows delivery performance metrics segmented by driver, with ability to drill down and understand delivery failure reasons and average delivery times for each driver.
- Delivery Comment Sentiment Analysis: Uses AI to perform sentiment analysis on delivery feedback comments and displays the overall sentiment score. It flags extreme (very positive and very negative) outliers for further review.
- Interactive Charts and Graphs: Presents delivery insights via interactive charts and graphs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong teal (#008080) to represent efficiency and logistics.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E0EEEE) to create a calm and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FFA500) to highlight key metrics and call to action buttons. It differs substantially in brightness and saturation to ensure excellent contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear and concise icons to represent different delivery metrics (e.g., a truck icon for delivery status, a clock icon for delivery time).
- Implement a clean and well-organized layout, with clear separation between data sections.
- Use subtle transitions when loading and updating data to enhance user experience.
